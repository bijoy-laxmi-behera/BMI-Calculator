## Overview
The BMI Calculator is a graphical application developed using Python's Tkinter library. It allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their height and weight inputs. The application provides immediate feedback on the calculated BMI and categorizes it into different health categories such as Underweight, Normal, Overweight, and Obese.

## Features
- **BMI Calculation:** Calculates BMI based on user-provided height and weight.
- **Health Category Classification:** Classifies BMI into health categories with informative messages.
- **Interactive GUI:** User-friendly graphical interface with sliders for height and weight inputs.
- **Visual Feedback:** Displays BMI results prominently with descriptive health messages.
- **Customizable Scale:** Adjusts the visual representation of height dynamically.

## Installation
To run the BMI Calculator locally:
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/bmi-calculator.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the application: `python bmi_calculator.py`

## Dependencies
